	
Face Rotation Classifier Description- Designed and deployed a deep learning system to classify facial images into four rotation classes (0, 90, 180, 270) using the Celeb A dataset . Implemented end-to-end workflows including data augmentation, model training, and deployment. Engineered a dynamic data augmentation pipeline using PyTorch with transformations (rotation, blurring, scaling, color jittering) to improve model robustness, achieving 92.5% validation accuracy with ResNet50.Trained and compared various architectures (VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, AlexNet ) to optimize performance, leveraging transfer learning for pre-trained models.Configure clean, modular code with a YAML configuration file for hyperparameter management, enabling easy reproducibility and model switching.
